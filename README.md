For the second map in this assignment I used data from the Seattle police department that contained the locations of all motor vehicle accidents that occurred and an officer came to the scene on a given day.  The dataset is updated every few hours and I chose to use every collision that was listed on February 23, 2016.  I was able to aggregate the data by the ‘beat’ (ie. Neighborhood patrolled by officers) in which each collision took place.  Using zoom level conditioning I displayed the collision totals by particular beat at zoom levels 12 and 13 while all collisions were displayed at zoom levels 14 and 15.  

For the third map in this assignment I used the Seattle Parks data that I scraped from the Seattle parks and recreation website.  I created a map of Seattle with each of the parks identified by a dot that could be scrolled over by the user.  Upon scrolling the name and address of each park would pop up.  I intended users to appreciate the large number of parks that exist within Seattle.  I tried to include a few layers via compositing that would highlight the terrain of Seattle but they ended up turning out about the same shade of green.  I intended for a natural feeling to come through in the map rather than supplementing the park data with roads and buildings.  I thought that including roads, buildings and the like would detract from the prevalence of parks in the city.
